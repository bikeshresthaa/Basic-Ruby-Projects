# Caesar-Cipher
This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher — one of the oldest and easiest encryption techniques — in Ruby. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, “HELLO” becomes “KHOOR”. The program will allow the user to both encrypt and decrypt messages by specifying the shift value.
